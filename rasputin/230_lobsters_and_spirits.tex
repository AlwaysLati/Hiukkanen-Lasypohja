\song{Lobsters and spirits (\textit{230})}{Stenka rasin}

There's a lobster on the ceiling, \\ looking down with eerie eye. \\ :,: Don't give in to anxious feeling, \\ open bottles, let caps fly. :,: \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ On the floor there's cancer creeping, \\ planning on your flesh to feast. \\ :,: It's no time for fearful weeping, \\ take a sip to kill the beast. :,: \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ An octopussy tries to grab you, \\ with tentacles your face it raids. \\ :,: Another glass and you will pull through, \\ win the favour of the maids. :,: \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ A herd of cattle roams the table, \\ crowd that smells of milk and grass. \\ :,: Drink the booze and you'll be able \\ to kick their bloody bovine ass. :,:
