\song{Parachuter (\textit{227})}{}

My brother was a parachuter in the U.S. \\ Marines (x3) \\ And he ain't gonna jump no more \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ Glory, glory what a hell of a way to die (x3) \\ And he ain't gonna jump no more \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ He jumped from eighteen thousand feet \\ without a parachute... \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ He was the last to leave the plane but first \\ to hit the ground... \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ He hit the ground and turned into a ten-by- \\ ten feet square... \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ They scraped him off and sent him to the \\ ketchup factory... \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ Solo:  \\ So think of my dear brother when you \\ eat at Burger King (x3) \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ All:  \\ Â‘cause he ain't gonna jump no more.
