Fuksi, there's no need to feel down \\ I said, Fuksi, fly in from abroad \\ I said, Fuksi, cause you're in a new town \\ There's no need for you to study \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ Fuksi, there's a place you can go \\ I said, Fuksi, when you're short on your \\ dough \\ You can stay there, and I'm sure you will \\ find \\ Many ways to have a good time \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ It's fun to stay at the I.N.T.O. \\ It's fun to stay at the I.N.T.O. \\ They have everything for Fuksis to enjoy \\ You can hang out with all of us \\ It's fun to stay at the I.N.T.O. \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ It's fun to stay at the I.N.T.O. \\ You can get yourself friends \\ That you meet in the hall \\ You can hear Autek through the wall \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ Fuksi, are you listening to me? \\ I said, Fuksi, what do you want to be? \\ I said, Fuksi, you will not be last dipped \\ But you got to know this one thing \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ No man drinks it all by himself \\ I said, Fuksi, grab the cups from the shelf \\ And just go there to the I.N.T.O. \\ I'm sure they have darts there to throw \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ It's fun to stay at the I.N.T.O....
