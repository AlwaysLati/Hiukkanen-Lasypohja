\song{Dear Friends (\textit{234})}{The Marriage of Figaro}

My dear friends our grand feast will begin \\ here \\ Our glasses we raise with a wild cheer \\ :,: But tonight we won't drink any light beer \\ Just champagne will put us in the mood :,: \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ All night drinks down our throats we'll be \\ pouring, \\ We'll remember the good times, not the \\ boring \\ :,: Through the ceiling our song will be \\ soaring \\ Finnish spirits are much more than good :,: \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ When friends drink too much with one \\ another \\ They make new memories more than \\ rather \\ :,: You can trust everyone like your brother, \\ We won't run out drinks, maybe food :,:
