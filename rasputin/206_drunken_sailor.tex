(x3) \\ Early in the morning! \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ Hooray and up she rises (x3) \\ Early in the morning! \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ Throw him in the longboat 'til he's sober... \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ Shave his belly with a rusty razor... \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ Put him in the hold with the Captain's daughter... \\ \hspace{10mm} \\ That's what we do with a drunken sailor...
