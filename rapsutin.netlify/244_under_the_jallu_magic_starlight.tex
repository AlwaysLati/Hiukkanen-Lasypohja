\song{Under the Jallu magic starlight (\textit{244})}{}

            Under Jallu's magic starlight  \\
            Not the highest star, but most bright \\
            I look through my empty shot glass \\
            And I fill it up again \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Under Jallu's magic starlight \\
            Our strong drinks are cut from first bite  \\
            From this magic drink, a shelter  \\
            will make for my sad days \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Chorus: \\
            :,: And under Jallu's starlight \\
            I will take one, for a safe flight \\
            Only under Jallu's soft sight  \\
            I will cry a joyful tear :,: \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Under Jallu's magic starlight  \\
            Singer's throat gets dry and so tight  \\
            Only getting booze he feels right \\
            And can move on from this day \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Under Jallu's magic starlight  \\
            Creeps a frost my soul cannot fight  \\
            But by corking one more tonight  \\
            My heart is warmed again \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Chorus: \\
            :,: And under Jallu's starlight  \\
            I will take one, for a safe flight  \\
            Only under Jallu's soft sight  \\
            I will cry a joyful tear :,: \\
