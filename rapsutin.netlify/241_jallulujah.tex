\song{Jallulujah (\textit{241})}{Hallelujah}

            I heard there was a single star \\
            That shines so brightly from afar \\
            The evening young, the party just beginning \\
            We came up to the open doors \\
            The tables set on the party floors \\
            Now in the glasses pour the Jaloviina \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            This seems familiar let me think \\
            I've sung these songs and I've drunk this drink \\
            I used to sing alone before I came here \\
            I turn my head to left to right  \\
            My comrades are a joyful sight \\
            So in our glasses raise the Jaloviina \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            It's late but not yet time for bed \\
            You gently rest your weary head \\
            And close your eyes as dreams they overcome you \\
            Your comrades hear you loudly snore \\
            Decide that they can take no more \\
            So on your lips they pour the Jaloviina \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina, Jaloviina \\
