\song{Walking down Canal Street (\textit{229})}{}

            Walking down Canal street, knocking every door,  \\
            God damn son of a bitch, I couldn't find a whore. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            I finally found a whore, she was rather thin,  \\
            God damn son of a bitch, I couldn't get it in. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            I finally got it in, worked it all about,  \\
            God damn son of a bitch, I couldn't get it out. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            I finally got it out, my dick was wet and sore.  \\
            The moral of this story is to never fuck a whore. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Six weeks later, I went for a piss,  \\
            Goddamn son of a bitch, she gave me syphilis! \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Nine months later, I'd forgotten what I did,  \\
            Goddamn son of a bitch, she brought me home a kid! \\
