\song{Sober-Man (\textit{243})}{Spider Man}

            Sober-Man, Sober-Man \\
            Does whatever a sober can \\
            Drives a car, any size \\
            is allowed to even fly \\
            Look out \\
            Here comes the Sober-Man \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Is he strong? \\
            Listen bud \\
            He's got non-alcoholic blood  \\
            Can he walk in straight lines? \\
            Take a look: just fine \\
            Hey, there \\
            There goes the Sober-Man \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            In the chill of night \\
            His friend is too drunk \\
            Water hits just right \\
            The night is not a flunk \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Sober-Man, \\
            Sober-Man, \\
            Friendly wholesome Sober-Man  \\
            Whisky coke He's ignored \\
            No hangover, his reward \\
            To him, \\
            life is great when he wakes up  \\
            At the morning lecture first up \\
            You'll find the Sober-Man \\
