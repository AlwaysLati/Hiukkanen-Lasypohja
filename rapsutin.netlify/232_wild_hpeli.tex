\song{Wild Hpeli (\textit{232})}{Wild Rover}

            I’ve been a wild student for many a year \\
            And spent all my money on patches and beer \\
            But now I’m returning with funds in the bank \\
            And I will never play Herwantapeli no more \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            And it’s no nay never \\
            No nay never no more \\
            Will I play the Herwanta - peli \\
            No never no more \\
             \\
            I went to guild that I used to frequent \\
            And I told the board members my lipetti were spent \\
            I asked them for credit, they answered me \\
            “nay, such a fuksi as you we could have any day” \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            And it’s no nay never... \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            I took from my pocket ten student loans bright \\
            And the board member’s eyes opened bright with delight \\
            They said “we have Gambina and Jallu the best \\
            And we’ll take you downstairs and show you the rest” \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            And it’s no nay never... \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            I’ll go home to my tutors, confess what I’ve done \\
            And I’ll ask them to pardon their prodigal fuks’ \\
            And if they forgive me as oft times before \\
            I never will play the Herwantapeli no more \\
