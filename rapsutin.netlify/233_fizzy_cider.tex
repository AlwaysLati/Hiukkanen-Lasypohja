            Fizzy Cider, CAN WE DRINK IT? \\
            Fizzy Cider, YES WE CAN! \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Students all know it and freshmen, too, \\
            Cider is cheap but tastes like glue. \\
            After your taste buds have gone numb, \\
            Drinking more cider ainâ€™t that dumb! \\
