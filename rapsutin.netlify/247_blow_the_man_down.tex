\song{Blow the man down (\textit{247})}{}

            As I was a-walkin' down paradise street  \\
            To-me, way hey, blow the man down  \\
            A Liverpool bobbie I chanced for to meet  \\
            Give me some time to blow the man down \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            I say you're a Black Baller by the cut of your hair \\
            To-me, way hey, blow the man down  \\
            And you've robbed some poor Dutchman of the clothes that you wear \\
            Give me some time to blow the man down \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Oh, policeman, policeman, you do me great wrong \\
            To-me, way hey, blow the man down  \\
            I'm a flying' fish sailor just home from Hong Kong \\
            Give me some time to blow the man down \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            So I smashed in his face and I stove-in in his jaw \\
            To-me, way hey, blow the man down  \\
            Says he, "look here young fella, you're breakin' the law!" \\
            Give me some time to blow the man down \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Well, they gave me six months here in Liverpool town \\
            To-me, way hey, blow the man down \\
            For beatin' and kickin' and blowin' him down \\
            Give me some time to blow the man down \\
            Well, we're Liverpool born boys and Liverpool bred \\
            To-me, way hey, blow the man down \\
            Thick in the arm boys and thick in the head  \\
            Give me some time to blow the man down \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Blow the man down, to-me, blow the man down \\
            To-me, way, hey blow the man down  \\
            Blow him right back into Liverpool town  \\
            Give me some time to blow the man down \\
