\song{Syphilis (\textit{211})}{Yesterday}

            Syphilis, \\
            it just started with a simple kiss. \\
            Now it even hurts to take a piss. \\
            Oh how did I get syphilis. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Leprosy, \\
            I’m not half the man I used to be. \\
            Now my fingertips are leaving me. \\
            Oh I believe I’ve leprosy. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\

            Now my dripping dick won’t get hard like \\
            yesterday..ay..ay..ay. \\

            Yesterday, \\
            my cock was always coming out to play. \\
            Now it needs two weeks to hide away. \\
            Oh I believe in yesterday, \\
            I believe in yesterday. \\
