\song{How Many Drinks (\textit{235})}{Blowing in the Wind}

            How many drinks can a man drink up \\
            and still see all just in one? \\
            And how many times can he empty his cup \\
            before all his senses are gone? \\
            Yes and how many times can he walk to the store \\
            and still be fit to buy more? \\
            The answer my friend you should not try to find. \\
            The answer will surely blow your mind! \\
