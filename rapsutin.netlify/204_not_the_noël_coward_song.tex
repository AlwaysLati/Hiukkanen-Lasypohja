            Soolo: \\
            Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis. \\
            Isn't it frightfully good to have a dong. \\
            It's swell to have a stiffy, \\
            It's divine to own a dick, \\
            From the tiniest little tadger \\
            To the world's biggest prick \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            So, three cheers for your Willy or John Thomas, \\
            hooray for your one-eyed trouser snake \\
            Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, \\
            Your Percy, or your cock. \\
            You can wrap it up in ribbons, \\
            you can slip it in your sock, \\
            but don't take it out in public \\
            or they will stick you in the dock \\
            And you won't a-come a-back. \\
