\song{Finland (\textit{200})}{}

            Chorus: \\
            Finland, Finland, Finland, \\
            the country where I want to be. \\
            Ponytrekking or camping, \\
            or just watching TV. \\
            Finland, Finland, Finland, \\
            it’s the country for me. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Verse: \\
            You’re so near to Russia, \\
            so far from Japan. \\
            Quite a long way from Cairo, \\
            lots of miles from Vietnam. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Chorus: \\
            Finland, Finland, Finland, \\
            the country where I want to be. \\
            Eating breakfast or dinner, \\
            or snack lunch in the hall. \\
            Finland, Finland, Finland, \\
            Finland has it all. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Verse: \\
            You’re so sadly neglected, \\
            and often ignored. \\
            A poor second to Belgium, \\
            when going abroad. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Chorus: \\
            Finland, Finland, Finland, \\
            The country where \\
            I quite want to be. \\
            Your mountains so lofty, \\
            your treetops so tall. \\
            Finland, Finland, Finland, \\
            Finland has it all. \\
