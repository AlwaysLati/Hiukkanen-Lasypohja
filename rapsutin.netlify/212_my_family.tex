\song{My family (\textit{212})}{My Bonnie}

            My father makes counterfeit money, \\
            my mother brews synthetic gin. \\
            My sister sells kisses to sailors, \\
            my God how the money rolls in. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Rolls in, rolls in, \\
            my God how the money rolls in, rolls in! \\
            Rolls in, rolls in, \\
            my God how the money rolls in, rolls in. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            My brother’s a slum missionary, \\
            he’s saving young girls from the sin. \\
            He’ll save you a blond for a shilling, \\
            my God how the money rolls in. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Rolls in... \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            My aunt keeps a girl seminary, \\
            she’s teaching young girls to begin. \\
            She doesn’t say where they shall finish, \\
            my God how the money rolls in. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Rolls in... \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            My uncle’s a Harley street surgeon, \\
            with instruments long, sharp and thin. \\
            He only knows one operation, \\
            my God how the money rolls in! \\
