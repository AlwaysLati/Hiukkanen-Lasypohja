\song{Sink (\textit{225})}{Help}

            Sink! oh please sink right now \\
            Sink! not just anyhow \\
            Sink! you know you're going down, siiiiink \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            When I was fuksi, so much fuksier than today \\
            I learnt anti-Turku hatred in oh so many ways \\
            But now this day has come, I'm standing in your torg \\
            It's time to jump and jump around, and \\
            make you fall apart. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Sink you turkulaiset, going down \\
            And we do appreciate if you all drown \\
            Sink and separate from our ground \\
            Won't you please, please sink nyt. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            I really find your castle boring in oh so many ways, \\
            Your independence seems to vanish in the haze. \\
            Your ugly mustard makes me puke that is for sure \\
            I know that I hate it like I've never done before \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Sink you turkulaiset, going down... \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            When you were younger, so much younger than today, \\
            you ruled this country but to-our-luck, then you burned away \\
            And now these days are gone, and all that you've got left \\
            is stinky aura, Swedish roots and that lame posankka of yours \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Sink you turkulaiset, going down \\
            And we do appreciate if you all drown \\
            Sink and separate from our ground \\
            Won't you please, please sink nyt, sink nyt, sink nyyyyyyt. \\
