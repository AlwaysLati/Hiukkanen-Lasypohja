\song{Clementine (\textit{210})}{Oh my darling Clementine}

            In a cavern, in a canyon, \\
            excavating for a mine. \\
            Dwelt a miner, forty-niner, \\
            and his daughter Clementine. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Oh my darling, oh my darling, \\
            oh my darling Clementine! \\
            Thou art lost and gone forever, \\
            dreadful sorry, Clementine. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Light she was and like a fairy, \\
            and her shoes were number nine. \\
            Herring boxes without topses, \\
            sandals were for Clementine. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Oh my darling... \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Drove she ducklings to the water \\
            every morning just at nine. \\
            Hit her foot against a splinter, \\
            fell into the foaming brine. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Oh my darling... \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Ruby lips above water, \\
            blowing bubbles soft and fine. \\
            But, alas, I was no swimmer, \\
            so I lost my Clementine. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Oh my darling... \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            How I missed her, how I missed her \\
            How I missed my Clementine. \\
            So I kissed her little sister, \\
            And forgot my Clementine. \\
