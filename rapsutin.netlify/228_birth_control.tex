\song{Birth Control (\textit{228})}{Yesterday}

            Birth control, \\
            It’s the only way to save your soul, \\
            when you’re playing with your girlfriend’s hole. \\
            Oh I believe in birthcontrol. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Suddenly, \\
            There’s a shotgun banging over me, \\
            I’m confronted with a pregnancy. \\
            Oh I believe in birthcontrol. \\
\hspace{10mm} \\
            Why I had to come, \\
            I don’t know, she wouldn’t blow. \\
            Now there’s something wrong, \\
            and I long for birthcontrol! \\
