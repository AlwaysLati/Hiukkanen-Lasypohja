\song{I used to roll the dice}{Viva La Vida}

I used to rule the world \\
Seas would rise when I gave the word \\
Now in the morning, I sleep alone \\
Sweep the streets I used to own \\
\hspace{10mm}\\
I used to roll the dice \\
Feel the fear in my enemy's dice \\
Listen as the dice would roll \\
Now the dice has been rolled, dice has been rolled \\
One minute, I rolled the dice \\
Next I used to roll the dice \\
And I used to roll the dice \\
Upon rolling the dice and rolling the dice \\
\hspace{10mm}\\
I hear Jerusalem dice a-rollin' \\
Roman Cavalry dice are rollin' \\
Be my dice, my dice and dice \\
My missionaries that rolled the dice \\
For some reason, I can't explain \\
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word \\
And that was when I rolled to dice \\
\hspace{10mm}\\
It was a wicked and wild dice \\
Blew down the doors, I rolled the dice \\
Shattered windows and the sound of dice \\
People couldn't believe what I had rolled \\
I used to roll the dice \\
For I used to roll the dice \\
Just a dice that I used to roll \\
Aw, who would ever roll the dice? \\
\hspace{10mm}\\
I hear Jerusalem dice a-rollin' \\ 
Roman Cavalry dice are rollinâ€™ \\
Be my dice, my dice and dice \\
My missionaries that rolled the dice \\
For some reason, I can't explain \\
I know T-TYMI won't roll the dice \\
Never rolled the dice \\
But that was when I rolled the dice \\
\hspace{10mm}\\
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh \\
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh \\
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh \\
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh \\
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh \\
\hspace{10mm}\\
